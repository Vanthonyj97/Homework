This led to work in the garment industry, designing copies of designer clothing.[6] Owens then met Michèle Lamy, who at this time was well-known in the Los Angeles social scene and owned the "Lamy" sportswear brand.</P></li>

    <h2>About Rick Owens</h2>
    <p>Rick Owens is a American Fashion designer, known for his Gothic styles. His career began in LA with the help of his wife. He is famous for his Geobasket Design. Owens broke into the highest echelons of the industry after French Vogue ran an image of Kate Moss wearing one of his leather jackets. Owens was able to utilise the momentum with assistance from Anna Wintour and American Vogue, and the publication sponsored his first show at New York Fashion Weeks Spring/Summer 2002 season. He also began his longstanding collaboration with stylist Panos Yiapanis in 2001 who, to date, has worked on every single one of Owens presentations.</p>
